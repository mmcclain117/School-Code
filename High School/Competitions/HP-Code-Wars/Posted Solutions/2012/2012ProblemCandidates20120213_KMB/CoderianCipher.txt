Took me a couple of read-throughs before I realized how the key was
consecutive letters of the plaintext minus spaces, you might want to change
the last sentence to be "Here, the key is seen spanning the third through
fifth words of the Example Output".


Took me about fifteen minutes to code up and just a couple of minutes to
test out.
