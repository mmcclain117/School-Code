WidgetCo, Houston, TX - April 1, 2003.  For immediate release.

WidgetCo announced today the immediate availability of the UltraWidget 3000, the first all-titanium widget in a 26cm diameter form factor.  The UltraWidget 3000 not only increases cross-phase velocity, but also reduces temporal drag by 16% (when compared to other widgets in its class).  WidgetCo Vice President Bill Hottaire said this morning that "the WidgetCo UltraWidget 3000 is the most advanced non-carbon-fiber widget available".  The UltraWidget 3000 will be available from all WidgetCo dealers by the end of September.  Pricing has not been finalized, but is expected to be under $7000 per widget in quantities of 1000 or more.
